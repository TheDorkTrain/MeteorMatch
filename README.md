Once preferences are selected and submit is clicked, the application brings the user to a second page where the alien profile is displayed. On this page, the user has the option to generate a pick-up line to break-the-ice with the alien. They will want to copy and paste the pick-up line to the chat box below it. At this point, the alien will respond in real-time and the conversation can go on as long as the user wants.
